      <p>We have concluded corresponding contracts for order data processing with the providers.</p>
      <p>IP anonymization applies to this website. The user's IP address is shortened within the member states of the
        EU and the European Economic Area. This shortening eliminates the personal reference to your IP address. As
        part of the agreement on the order data agreement that the website operator has concluded with Google Inc.,
        the website operator uses the information collected to evaluate website usage and website activity and
        provides services related to internet usage.</p>
      <p>Data processing takes place on the basis of the legal provisions of Section 96 (3) TKG and Art 6 (1) lit a
        (consent) and / or f (legitimate interest) of the GDPR.</p>
      <p>Our concern within the meaning of the GDPR (legitimate interest) is the improvement of our offer and our
        website. Since the privacy of our users is important to us, the user data is pseudonymized [pseudonymization
        is recommended for the legal reason "legitimate interest"; this has to be clarified with the web analysis
        service].</p>
      <p>The user data is kept for a period of 26 months.</p>
      <p><strong>Your rights</strong></p>
      <p>In principle, you have the right to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability,
        revocation and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your
        data protection claims have otherwise been violated, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria
        this is the data protection authority.</p>
